## Pignatra

This is a super basic implementation of an AJAX request in a Sinatra application that some of you wanted to see. Be sure to read through all of the comments as they explain some of the differences from the implementation (without AJAX) that I demoed yesterday (7/29). If you have any questions please let me know. Thanks to Emma Follender for providing her PigLatin gem for this example.
